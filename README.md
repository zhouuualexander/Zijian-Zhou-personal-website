## Description
This website is my personal first website<br>
I learnt the website style from Coursera fullstack-course4 and edited some codes into my style.<br>
I used Adobe Photoshop CC 2019 edit the homepage picture and it was taken by Ethan Zhou (my male elder cousin) in Hamilton.<br>
The hours in website is arbitrary and the address is of the University of Alberta.<br>
The left picture was taken from Main Quad in Ualberta.<br>
The middle picture was taken from Athabasca Hall.
